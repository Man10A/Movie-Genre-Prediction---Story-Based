# Movie-Genre-Prediction---Story-Based

Tools Used: Python, ML(Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborne), Text Analysis, Natural language processing

Implemented machine learning algorithms on large datasets with 23,499 movie details. Based on movie description/story, these algorithms predicted movie genre and improved prediction accuracy using models tuning.

Please refer to the ".ipbny" file uploaded that has all the information in detail.

I am sure the results can be improved and i am working on it. Thank you.
